                Coffee has been around for a long time and blamed for many ills — from stunting your growth to causing
                heart
                disease — but newer research shows that it may actually have health benefits.<br /><br />
                Recent studies have generally found no connection between coffee and an increased risk of heart disease
                or
                cancer.<br /><br />
                In fact, some studies have found an association between coffee consumption and decreased
                overall mortality and
                possibly cardiovascular mortality, although this may not be true in younger people who drink large
                amounts
                of
                coffee. <br /><br />
            </p>

            <p>

                <img src="images/about2.jpg" class="w3-round w3-image text-image" alt="Coffee picture">
                Why the apparent reversal in the thinking about coffee? Earlier studies didn't always take into
                account that
                known high-risk behaviors, such as smoking and physical inactivity, tended to be more common among
                heavy
                coffee
                drinkers.<br /><br />
                Studies have shown that coffee may have health benefits, including protecting against Parkinson's
                disease,
                type
                2 diabetes and liver disease, including liver cancer. Coffee also appears to improve cognitive
                function and
                decrease the risk of depression.<br /><br />
                However, the research appears to bear out some risks. High consumption of unfiltered coffee (boiled
                or
                espresso)
                has been associated with mild elevations in cholesterol levels.<br /><br />
                In addition, some studies found that two or more cups of coffee a day can increase the risk of heart
                disease
                in
                people with a specific — and fairly common — genetic mutation that slows the breakdown of caffeine
                in the
                body.
                So, how quickly you metabolize coffee may affect your health risk.<br /><br />Although coffee may
                have fewer risks compared with benefits, keep in mind that
                other
                beverages, such as milk and
                some fruit juices, contain nutrients that coffee doesn't. Also, adding cream and sugar to your
                coffee adds fat
                and calories — up to hundreds of calories in some cases.
