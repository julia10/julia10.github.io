About Me 

I'm a 23 year old first year student studying Software Design in AthloneIT. 

My passion is all about learning new subjects and technologies. Web and game development brought the most joy to my student life as by learning these subjects I understood that the beauty of programming is the structure and I love it. Structuring everything makes the most difficult problems easy to solve.

When I am not programming you can find me experimenting with coffees. I am always trying to improve my barista skills and show to everyone around what a real coffee should look like.
